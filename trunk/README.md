### 1.2 Installing

__Note__: We suppose you already installed the dependencies for your operating system. Otherwise follow these [instructions](prerequisites "Prerequisites").

You can install *CN-Wheat* either in "install" or "develop" mode.

#### 1.2.1 Install *CN-Wheat* in "install" mode

Install *CN-Wheat* in "install" mode if you're not going to develop, edit or debug 
it, i.e. you just want to used it as third party package.

To install *CN-Wheat* in "end-user" mode:

* open a command line interpreter,
* go to your local copy of project *CN-Wheat*,
* run command: `python setup.py install --user`.

#### 1.2.2 Install *CN-Wheat* in "develop" mode

Install *CN-Wheat* in "develop" mode if you want to get *CN-Wheat* installed and then 
be able to frequently edit the code and not have to re-install *CN-Wheat* to have the 
changes to take effect immediately.

To install *CN-Wheat* in "develop" mode:

* open a command line interpreter,
* go to your local copy of project *CN-Wheat*,
* run command: `python setup.py develop --user`.

## 2. Reading the docs

To build the documentation:

* install the model (see [Installation of the model](installing "Installing")), 
* open a command line interpreter,
* go to the top directory of your local copy of the project,
* run this command: `python setup.py build_sphinx`,
* and direct your browser to file `doc/_build/html/index.html`.

## 3. Testing

The automated test permits to verify that the model implementation accurately 
represents the developer’s conceptual description of the model and its solution.

The automated test:

* initializes the model from input data in CSV files,
* runs the model on 2 steps, forcing the photosynthesis and senescence parameters 
  before each run of the model,
* concatenate the outputs of the model in dataframes, with one dataframe per topological scale,
* write the outputs dataframes to CSV files,
* compare actual to expected outputs,
* raise an error if actual and expected outputs are not equal up to a given tolerance.     

To run the automated test with coverage report:

* install the model (see [Installation of the model](installing "Installing")), 
* open a command line interpreter,
* go to the directory `test` of your local copy of the project,
* and run this command: `nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=cnwheat test_cnwheat.py`.

The automated test does not verify the validity of the model, i.e. it doesn't permit 
to determine the degree to which the model is an accurate representation of the 
real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model.  
To help verifying the validity of the model, use the plotting tools implemented 
in module `cnwheat.tools`.   

## Deployment

*CN-Wheat* can be coupled with other ecophysiological models, to simulate the interaction 
between CN distribution and (for example) leaves elongation, photosynthesis, growth, 
senescence, light interception and topology of wheat crops.  
Please contact <cn-wheat-request@groupes.renater.fr> for more information about the 
possibility of coupling and integrate *CN-Wheat* with other ecophysiological models.
