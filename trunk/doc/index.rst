.. topic:: Overview

    CN-Wheat is a Functional-Structural Plant Model which simulates the distribution 
    of carbon and nitrogen into wheat culms in relation to photosynthesis, 
    N uptake, metabolite turnover, root exudation and tissue death. 
    This model can therefore predict the temporal variations and the distribution of 
    carbon and nitrogen into wheat culms.
